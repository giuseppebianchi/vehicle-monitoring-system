# Vehicles Monitoring System

A simple web app for AVM systems, written in React and TypeScript, to show location based data in Real Time.

You just need to define the interface of your remote data model.
My custom components (`to improve`) are based on [Tailwind CSS](http://tailwindcss.com) style libray (for now loaded via `CDN to keep configuration simple).


# Vehicles View

This view presents a list of API endpoints provided by the user, where they can be selected to request remote data and then showing results on map as markers.

## Real Time
Realtime stream is can be handled by user via GET requests, setting its favorite interval time to fetchd data or via WebSockets (`incoming) as well.

## Filter View
Results are shown on map as markers and their information are listed in a scrollbar. Clicking on a  marker will open a popup, that contains all information about the tracked vehicle.

`incoming`

This view allows you to show on map vehicles data with some GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) data provided from a Public Transport Agency, such as bus stops, routes and trips.
